Welcome to Chenhao's personal website! I am a first year Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University in [VIPER lab](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~ips/students.html), fortunately has [Prof. Fengqing Zhu](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~zhu0/) as my advisor. Prior to joining Purdue,I obtained my master degree in NYU, where I had a wonderful time at the [NYU VIDEO LAB](https://wp.nyu.edu/videolab/) under the guidance of [Prof. Yao Wang](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/yao-wang). I also had the opportunity to work with [Prof. Ivan Selesnick](https://eeweb.engineering.nyu.edu/iselesni/).
